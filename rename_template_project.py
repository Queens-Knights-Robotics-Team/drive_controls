This script replaces all instance of 'taproot-template-project' with a user specified
project name (<new-repo-name>) and replaces 'taproot-template' with
'<new-repo-name>-project'. It is assumed that the <new-repo-name> is the name of
the repository created that the taproot-template-project was copied to.

Also updates the copyright license header with the team name, which you must also
specify.

This script also renames the `template-project` directory with
'<new-repo-name>-project.'

If, for example, you run this script and specify a <new-repo-name> as 'cool-team',
the repository you created will have the following directory structure

|-- cool-team
|   |-- cool-team-project
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- ...
