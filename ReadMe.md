# Drive Controls
## Getting Started - clone this repository with the following command...
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:Queens-Knights-Robotics-Team/drive_controls.git`<br/><br/>
Change your working directory to `.../drive_controls` and run the setup script that corresponds to your operating system to download all of the necessary development tools:<br/>
`.\setup-windows.bat`<br/>
`./setup-mac.zsh`<br/>
`./setup-deb-linux.sh`<br/><br/>
Change your working directory to '`.../drive_controls/testing`' and run the command:<br/>
`python3 deploy.py --help`<br/><br/>
Once executed, the python script will print its usage to the terminal, allowing you to begin testing code for either the controller or keyboard & mouse<br/>
## Notes...
- setup scripts for Windows and Linux are yet to be implemented but will be soon
